# Replace_String

•	Identify program structure and control the flow of execution.
•	Write structured programming instructions so that the computer shows
input/output behaviors
•	Use for loops to write code with a required number of iterations.
•	Build programs that can construct or parse strings.
•	Create formatted outputs by using strings
•	Demonstrate logical thinking by using programming syntax and strategies.

Overview

Write a C++ program that takes a single-line input string. Your program also
collects a search string and a replace string. Finally, your program should
search for all occurrences of the given search string in the single-line input
and replaces them all with the replace string.

Directions

In the single-line input, there can be two or more occurrences of the same
search string. The search string can be followed by a space character (' '),
comma (','), or full stop character ('.'). Therefore, use a loop, inside the
loop at every iteration replace one search string with the replace string.
Repeat this process until all the search strings are replaced.

Sample Input/output 01:

Single Line Input String:
Alex is a good student. Programming is fun for Alex.
Search String:
Alex
Replace String:
Your Name
Your Name is a good student. Programming is fun for Your Name.
